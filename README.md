# Stochastic-Modeling-of-Blackjack
Blackjack is one of the most analyzed casino games due to its mix of chance and strategy. This work develops a comprehensive mathematical model of blackjack play under the optimal basic strategy, using tools from Markov chain theory. We construct Markov chain models for both the dealer’s fixed drawing rules and the player’s decision process, capturing the dynamics of hitting, standing, doubling down, splitting pairs, and other options. By computing transition probability matrices and absorption probabilities, we derive the player’s expected outcome (advantage or disadvantage) per hand when the player follows optimal play. The model was built in Python and is validated by comparison with classical analyses (Baldwin et al., 1956; Thorp, 1962) and more recent ones (Wakin & Rozell, 2004): under typical rules, the house edge against a basic-strategy player is found to be approximately 0.57%. The methodology demonstrates how stochastic modeling yields precise game odds and provides a foundation for analyzing rule variations and card-counting extensions.
